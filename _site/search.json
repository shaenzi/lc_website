    "text": "As this silly virus has become an inextricable part of my life, I’d like to stay at least somewhat up to date both regarding the level of virus around me as well as the research that is happening on it. Initially, I found many involved scientists to follow on Twitter/X, but as I moved away from that platform, I needed to find new sources of information. I’d like to share some of these here, and I’m starting with the substack/blog of Eric Topol, a cardiologist and experienced researcher, as his latest post on Covid Brain arrived in my inbox today.\nGround Truths not only covers Covid-related topics but medical research in general, and Topol also interviews experts in other areas, which one can listen to as a podcast. I mostly read the covid content, and as usual, today’s post neatly summarises six research papers into digestible chunks, providing some context and implications."

    "text": "Covid Brain\nWell, now what is this covid brain? Despite having started and still often being labelled as a respiratory virus, Covid unfortunately affects many organs including the brain. Apparently, patients who were hospitalised with severe Covid still show signs of brain injury, or the equivalent of 20 years of aging. Cognitive scores also deteriorate in healthy young people with mild Covid.\nAs I haven’t read the original research papers, I’ll refer you to the Ground Truths post.\nAlso mentioned is a preprint by the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, showing that Covid reinfections are associated with a higher likelihood of Long Covid. So don’t think just because you got of lightly the first time that you’ll still be fine in future!\nAnyway, as Topol says, “We need to use our brains, rather than to leave them vulnerable to this god-awful virus.” One way to protect your brain is to get a booster shot - not only do you protect yourself, but also the (vulnerable) people around you. Win-win, right?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Long Covid patients are often invisible, as the illness forces them out of an everyday life, disappearing from the public. Media coverage is similarly sparse. However, one case was recently covered in depth in the Swiss Media: cyclist Marlen Reusser, European champion and Olympic medalist, has been forced to withdraw from both the Olympics and the World Championships this year due to Long Covid.\nA documentary was aired, in which you see her grapple with the new reality of being ill, having to avoid too much strain (such as a long interview) as otherwise she would pay for it the following days by being ill (the classical symptom of post-exertional malaise or PEM), and not knowing whether she’ll ever be able to compete again (sadly, I’d guess the outlook is not good, with a diagnosis of ME/CFS).\nYou can view the documentary here in German, some quotes:\n\n“We could have fun here, today, it’s not always the same, we could have along interview, that’s not the problem, I’d then pay for it in the next days. It’s totally crazy, I’m then sick.”\n“At the moment, I am chronically ill, and there are moments or times when I am better and times when I am worse, but I’m always not well.”\n\nIt’s impressive that Reusser is sharing this so openly, you can see how emotionally it is hard to come to terms with her new life. It is also painful to watch, how this humorous person and impressive sportswoman has been ground to a halt. I am grateful for her to share this experience, with so many aspects that I guess are common among long covid / ME/FCS patients, such as learning about PEM the hard way, uncertainty about the future, inability to continue your job or passion.\nIt’s also sad that even Reusser, who trained as a medical doctor and turned to cycling comparatively late, probably did not learn about post-infectious diseases and was just as surprised, overwhelmed and confused as everyone else, once symptoms didn’t go away.\nI wish her all the best and thank her for sharing her story."
